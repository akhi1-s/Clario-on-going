```bash
cd clario/frontend
open index.html   # Or open manually in a browser

## 🔐 Auth Flow

1. New users can **sign up**
2. Passwords are **hashed with bcrypt**
3. Upon login, a **JWT token** is issued
4. Protected routes are accessible only with valid tokens
5. Tokens stored in **localStorage**

## 📊 Data Visualization

Visual dashboards show:

- 📈 Completed vs. Pending tasks
- 🎭 Mood trends (emoji frequency)
- 🗓️ Event density over time

Charts are dynamically generated using Chart.js.
